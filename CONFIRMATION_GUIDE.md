# Community Confirmation Guide

This guide explains how you can help validate scripts in the `unconfirmed_experiments` folder and promote them to `confirmed_experiments`.

1. **Select a script** from `unconfirmed_experiments` that you want to test.
2. **Review the code** and understand what it does before running anything.
3. **Test in a safe environment** such as a virtual machine or dedicated test machine.
4. **Document your results** including any modifications or dependencies.
5. **Submit feedback** through a pull request or issue. Include logs or notes about the test outcome.
6. After enough community validation, the script can be moved to `confirmed_experiments`.

Your participation helps make these scripts reliable and safe for everyone.
