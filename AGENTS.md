# Repository Instructions

This repository contains USB Rubber Ducky payloads that interact with GPT-based services. Two top-level folders store experiments:

- `unconfirmed_experiments/` – draft or proof-of-concept scripts. Anything here should be treated as experimental.
- `confirmed_experiments/` – scripts that have been tested and approved for general use.

When contributing new scripts:
1. Place untested or in-progress payloads inside `unconfirmed_experiments/`.
2. After validating a script, move it to `confirmed_experiments/`.
3. Keep filenames and documentation in English.
4. Run repository checks before committing, if any are defined.

These instructions apply to all files in this repository.
